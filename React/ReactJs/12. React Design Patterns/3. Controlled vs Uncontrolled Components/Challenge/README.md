### Challenge: Build a Form with Controlled and Uncontrolled Components

#### **Task:**

Create a simple form with the following fields:

- **First Name** (Text input)
- **Last Name** (Text input)
- **Email** (Email input)
- **Subscribe to newsletter** (Checkbox)
- **Message** (Textarea)

You are required to create two versions of the form:

1. **Controlled Components**: Where the form fields are managed by React state.
2. **Uncontrolled Components**: Where the form fields are managed by the DOM, and React doesnâ€™t directly track the value of each input.
